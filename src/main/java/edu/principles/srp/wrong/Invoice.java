/**
 * Uncle Bob Martin suggests that "components should be broken until each one has only one reason to change".
 * When we split responsibilities between smaller methods and classes, usually the system becomes easier to learn overall.
 * <p>
 * We can easily combine independent components in different ways for different purposes or depending on configuration
 * <p>
 * - Flexibility: It becomes possible to reuse components when they have a single, narrow responsibility
 * - Testability: Itâ€™s easier to write and maintain tests for methods and classes with focused, independent concerns.
